This repo contains:

1. wrinkle_synthesizer: synthesize basic images with wrinkles using blender

2. physical_simulator: simulate real sheet shape based on physics-based simulator

3. anomaly_detector: pipeline for train and test image segmentation/detection model

And some useful tools like visualizing wrinkles, generate simulato cpp code and so on

texture.zip contains the texture files scanned based on https://academy.substance3d.com/courses/your-smartphone-is-a-material-scanner, https://magazine.substance3d.com/your-smartphone-is-a-material-scanner-vol-ii/, we scanned the material then synthesize texture maps using substance designer
